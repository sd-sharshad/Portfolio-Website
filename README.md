♦️Javascript used for :-

💠✅ Contact Form Validation
💠Listens for the form’s submit event.
💠Prevents submission if any required fields (name, email, message) are empty.
💠Displays feedback to the user:
💠If fields are missing: shows an error message like “Please fill out all fields.”
💠If submission is valid: shows “Thank you! Your message has been sent.”
💠 🔄 Form Reset
💠Clears all inputs after a successful submission so users don’t have to manually erase content.

 ♦️ 🔐 No Backend Used
The form doesn’t actually send data to a server—it just simulates a submission and gives visual confirmation.


♦️How it Works
💠Save All the Four Files in a same Folder.
💠Run the Html File in Browser.
